In this repository are the module, fun.py, and the csv files that contain data from Google, Gaia DR2, Matt Walker, and Josh Simon. To access the dataframe, import the module as seen in the sample Jupyter notebook, test.ipynb.

The overall dataframe is given the letter "d". To call data, you must use d[0].(attribute). The file columns.txt has the columns that are under each data category for better organization.
